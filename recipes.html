          Spaghetti is a long, thin, cylindrical pasta of Italian origin, made
          from durum wheat semolina. It is one of the most popular varieties of
          pasta and is a staple food in traditional Italian cuisine. Typically
          served with a sauce, spaghetti can be paired with a wide range of
          ingredients such as tomatoes, olive oil, garlic, meat, and vegetables
          to create dishes like spaghetti alla Bolognese, which includes a
          meat-based sauce, or spaghetti aglio e olio, a simple dish made with
          garlic, olive oil, and chili flakes.

          Swedish pancakes, known as "pannkakor," are thin, crepe-like pancakes
          made from a batter of eggs, milk, and flour, often lightly sweetened
          with sugar. They are traditionally served with lingonberry jam and a
          dusting of powdered sugar, offering a delightful balance of sweetness
          and tartness that distinguishes them from their thicker, fluffier
          American counterparts.

          <li>
            Combine all ingredients in a blender and blend until completely
            smooth.Transfer to the refrigerator to rest for at least 2 hours or
            up to 2 days.
          </li>
          <li>
            Preheat the oven to 200 degrees if you plan to eat the pannkakor
            right away. Heat a 10 inch nonstick skillet over medium heat. Stir
            the batter briefly to recombine. Brush skillet with melted butter.
            Pick the skillet up off of the burner and quickly add ¼ cup of
            batter. Immediately begin swirling the batter around the skillet so
            that it coats the bottom of the pan. Continue swirling until the
            batter is just set. Return skillet to the burner. Cook until the
            pancake is golden brown in spots on the bottom, about 30 seconds.
            Use a thin spatula to loosen the pancake, flip it over continue to
            cook on the other side for about 30 seconds. Transfer to a plate.
            Cover with foil and transfer to oven to keep warm and repeat with
            remaining batter, wiping out skillet in between pancakes with paper
            towel as needed.

            Serve with lingonberry jam and butter (see note below) or other
            desired toppings and/or fillings. See notes below for more
            information about making ahead of time and storing in the
            refrigerator or freezer.

          Macaroni and cheese, commonly known as mac & cheese, is a comfort food
          staple that has captured the hearts of people all over the world.
          Originating from Europe and popularized in the United States, this
          dish consists of elbow macaroni pasta smothered in a creamy cheese
          sauce. The simplicity of its ingredients—pasta, cheese, and often a
          touch of butter or milk—belies a rich, complex flavor that has made it
          a favorite for both quick weeknight dinners and festive holiday
          gatherings.

              <li>
                Preheat oven to 375°. Grease a 13"x9" baking dish with butter. In a
                large pot of boiling salted water, cook macaroni, stirring
                occasionally, until al dente, 5 to 6 minutes. Drain.

                In a large saucepan over medium heat, melt 1 stick butter. Sprinkle

                minutes. Pour in milk and whisk until combined. Add mustard powder;
                season with salt and pepper. Bring to a simmer over medium-high heat

                Remove pan from heat and whisk in cheddar, Gruyère, and 1 cup
